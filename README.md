# Netflix_Clone
This project is a Netflix landing page clone built using pure HTML and CSS. It replicates the layout, sections, colors, and overall UI style of the real Netflix homepage. The goal of this project was to practice website structuring and improve front-end design skills while creating a clean, modern interface.

The website is fully responsive, working smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. I used flexbox, grid, and media queries to ensure the layout adjusts properly on all devices. The code is neatly organized in separate folders, making it easy to read and understand.

Through this project, I improved my understanding of responsive design, UI cloning, and clean CSS writing. It’s a beginner-friendly front-end project that helps build a strong foundation in HTML and CSS.
